### What are we doing?
1. Convert data from relational(Excel format) to Object Format (JSON) &
 Push data to mongodb.
2. Create dahsboard on powerbi.

3. Show aggregations - e.g the financial years, customer analysis
### 4. implement kafka
Why?
1. To simulate the realtime changes i.e. when a new payment is intiated, from the API or terminal it must be sent to the database and reflect on the powerBI.
2. The reflection must be automatic (we can schedule an interval refresh of powerbi).

### 5 Write the report including all the pipeline details(Refer to phase 2 Rubric)
### 6 Make a video.
### 7 Submit ðŸ˜Š
